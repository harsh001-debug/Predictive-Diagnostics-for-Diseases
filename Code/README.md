## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow  
The project is implemented in four Jupyter notebooks, which should be run in sequence:  

1. **[PDF Scanning & Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/Hashehri/Disease-Diagnosis-NLP-Project/blob/main/Code/read_pdf_file.ipynb)**  
   - Extract and clean text from the medical textbook.  
   - Perform initial data exploration.  

2. **[Topic Modeling](https://github.com/Hashehri/Disease-Diagnosis-NLP-Project/blob/main/Code/topic_modeling.ipynb)**  
   - Use NLP techniques to cluster diseases based on symptom descriptions.  

3. **[Supervised ML Model](https://github.com/Hashehri/Disease-Diagnosis-NLP-Project/blob/main/Code/classification_model.ipynb)**  
   - Train machine learning models to classify diseases.  

4. **[Predicting New Input](https://github.com/Hashehri/Disease-Diagnosis-NLP-Project/blob/main/Code/predict_new_input.ipynb)**  
   - Predict diseases based on user-provided symptom descriptions.
